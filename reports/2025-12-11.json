  "narrative_summary": "In the past 48 hours, there has been a notable surge in drone-related incidents across the United States, particularly focusing on smuggling operations involving contraband delivered to prisons. At least 20 incidents involved drones attempting to drop food items, including crab legs and steak, alongside marijuana, into prison yards in South Carolina. Guards intercepted most deliveries, reflecting ongoing challenges in reducing smuggling attempts. Additionally, various arrests were made involving the use of drones by law enforcement to capture fleeing suspects in connection to car thefts and other crimes. Some discussions on drone legislation and airspace violations also emerged, as authorities emphasize the need for clearer policies regarding drone usage in various contexts.",
