  "narrative_summary": "Over the past 48 hours, there has been a significant increase in reported drone incidents, particularly related to smuggling and security concerns. Multiple cases of drones being used to deliver contraband to prisons were recorded, highlighting a persistent issue with drug smuggling via aerial means. Countries like Denmark and Germany are responding to the growing threat, with Denmark banning drone flights at military bases and Germany considering measures against unauthorized drones. Additionally, incidents of border smuggling continue to be reported, raising alarms about the security implications across Europe. Notably, the involvement of law enforcement in some smuggling activities has prompted discussions on the need for stricter regulations and counter-drone technologies.",
