  "narrative_summary": "In the past 48 hours, a significant rise in drone-related incidents has been recorded across multiple countries, with key incidents emerging from Europe. Notably, both Belgium and the UK have grappled with disruptions caused by unauthorized drones near airports, prompting interventions from NATO nations. In Spain, authorities dismantled a drug smuggling network using drones to transport cannabis from Morocco, while arrests were made for similar activities in other locations. Incidents in Ukraine and Romania demonstrate the ongoing relevance of drone usage in conflict contexts, emphasizing surveillance over military assets and the risks associated with terrorism attempts. The handling of drone incidents signals heightened concerns about national security and airspace integrity.",
