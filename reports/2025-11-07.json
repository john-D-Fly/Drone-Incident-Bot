  "narrative_summary": "In the past 48 hours, several drone incidents have significantly impacted operations at airports across Belgium and Sweden, leading to flight suspensions and cancellations. Notably, Brussels Airport faced disruptions from multiple drone sightings, resulting in the halting of flights and hundreds of passengers being stranded. Similarly, drone sightings also interrupted operations at Gothenburg Airport in Sweden, marking the country's first significant airport closure due to a drone incident. Meanwhile, Israel has heightened responses to drone smuggling threats along its border with Egypt, further emphasizing the growing concern over drone-related risks both in aviation and security contexts. Additionally, various arrests connected to drug smuggling via drones have been reported, indicating a rising trend in illicit drone usage across borders. Overall, the escalating frequency of drone incidents poses notable safety and security challenges.",
