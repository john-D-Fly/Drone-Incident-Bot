In Australia, multiple individuals have been arrested for attempting to drop contraband into prisons using drones. In Denmark, military security has been heightened due to unauthorized drone sightings near military installations, prompting a temporary ban on civilian drone flights. Furthermore, Russia's continued drone attacks on Ukraine have resulted in fatalities, highlighting ongoing geopolitical tensions.
