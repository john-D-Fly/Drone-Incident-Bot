  "narrative_summary": "In the past 48 hours, multiple drone incidents have highlighted ongoing tensions in Ukraine, particularly around the use of drones for terrorism and smuggling. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy condemned a deadly Russian drone strike on a passenger train that resulted in at least five fatalities, reiterating the act as terrorism. Concurrently, there were reported cases of authorities foiling drug smuggling attempts using drones in various locations. The Pentagon is expanding counter-drone policies, and the issue of unauthorized drone use is becoming increasingly prevalent, especially concerning airport disruptions in several major U.S. cities. Overall, the geographic spread includes significant incidents in Ukraine and rising concerns regarding drone-related crimes elsewhere.",
