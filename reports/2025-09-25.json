  "narrative_summary": "In the past 48 hours, a surge in drone-related incidents has notably impacted Danish airports, with multiple closures and threats identified as deliberate attacks. The Danish Prime Minister labeled the disruptions as serious attacks on critical infrastructure. Concurrently, there were drone strikes in Eilat, Israel, leading to dozens of injuries, with Houthis claiming responsibility. Incidents related to drones facilitating smuggling and arrests also emerged in the U.S. As nations grapple with the increasing problem of airborne interference, vulnerabilities in aviation security are being tested more than ever. The geographical patterns emphasize both Europe and the Middle East as focal points of escalating drone activity.",
