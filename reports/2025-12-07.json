  "narrative_summary": "Over the past 48 hours, a series of drone-related incidents have been reported primarily around nuclear submarine bases in France and security events involving unidentified drones near a state visit by Ukraine's President Zelenskyy in Ireland. Notably, multiple illegal drone overflights and interception activities have raised concerns over national security, particularly at sensitive sites like submarine bases. Flights at Brussels Airport were disrupted due to sightings of drones, indicating a wider trend of airport disruptions caused by unauthorized drone activity.
