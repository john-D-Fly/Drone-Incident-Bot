  "narrative_summary": "In the past 48 hours, drone incidents have been varied, with notable activities including a significant drone strike by Russia against Ukraine that involved 165 drones. Germany is fast-tracking a counter-drone law, as airports and utilities remain at risk from unauthorized drone activity. A crash involving a drone carrying a live pig caused a power outage in Sichuan, China for 10 hours. Counter-drone measures are gaining momentum globally, highlighted by the Pentagon expanding its authority to secure U.S. military bases and a proposed Idaho bill aimed at banning drone flights near prisons due to rising concerns about illegal drops of contraband. Noteworthy also is Jordan's Southern Command thwarting a drone drug smuggling attempt. These incidents underscore the growing integration of drones into both security protocols and illicit activities, necessitating enhanced regulations.",
