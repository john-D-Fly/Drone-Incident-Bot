  "narrative_summary": "In the past 48 hours, drone-related incidents have fluctuated across various categories including smuggling, airport disruptions, and policy discussions. Noteworthy incidents include Azerbaijan intercepting a drone transporting drugs from Iran and multiple drug-smuggling attempts detected by the Army, highlighting the ongoing challenges posed by unauthorized drone activities. Concurrently, there were multiple disruptions at airports due to drone sightings, notably at Brussels Airport, indicating a rising trend in aviation-related risks. Policy discussions emerged, particularly in Michigan with proposals for a state-specific drone registry. The potential for terrorist threats also surfaced as discussions about drone defense technologies gained prominence. Overall, the incidents reflect a complex landscape of both security threats and evolving regulatory responses.",
