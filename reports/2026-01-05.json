  "narrative_summary": "In the last 48 hours, multiple drone incidents have emerged primarily in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Ukraine continues to launch drone strikes near Moscow, causing delays at airports, which was notably reported alongside the Kremlin's denial of attacks on Putin's residence. In Israel, significant efforts to curb weapon smuggling using drones have been highlighted, along with arrests linked to a local smuggling network. Furthermore, recent drone strikes in Russian border regions resulted in fatalities. There is a clear trend toward the use of drones for both military and illicit purposes, raising security concerns and prompting discussions about drone defense strategies in nations like Ireland.",
