  "narrative_summary": "Over the past 48 hours, a surge in drone incidents has been observed across various regions, particularly concentrated in Ukraine, where Russia has launched multiple drone strikes targeting infrastructure. Notably, drone strikes in Chernihiv injured civilians and damaged property. Additionally, several incidents in Belgium involved drone sightings over military bases, prompting investigations. There are emerging concerns about illegal drone activity, especially regarding prison contraband drops in Canada and smuggling operations linked to drug trafficking across borders in regions like Jammu. Meanwhile, drone disruptions at airports in Spain led to temporary closures, reflecting ongoing security challenges in the aviation sector.",
