# Drone News 48h Brief — October 31, 2025

_Window: last 48 hours; 47 incidents._

## Summary
In the past 48 hours, the drone-related landscape highlights a significant surge in smuggling incidents, particularly focused on prisons in the UK, where gangs are deploying advanced drones to deliver contraband, including drugs and weapons. Reports indicate a troubling 1,140% rise in drone sightings linked to a growing prison drugs crisis. In several cases, authorities have busted smuggling operations, with one valued at £300,000, illustrating the urgent need for enhanced drone detection measures across institutions. Additionally, drone incidents have also created disruptions in airports, with emergency closures prompted by unauthorized flights. This underscores a broadening concern over both operational security in correctional facilities and the safety implications for public spaces. The ongoing challenge of illicit drone use calls for robust policy responses to mitigate risks associated with drone technology in transport and security settings.
