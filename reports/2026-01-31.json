  "narrative_summary": "Over the past 48 hours, there has been a notable rise in drone-related incidents, primarily concentrated on smuggling and unauthorized use near significant events. In Punjab, India, authorities seized 96 kg of heroin linked to drone smuggling across the porous border with Pakistan. Concurrently, U.S. regulations have prohibited drone flights within 30 miles of the Super Bowl stadium, highlighting a focus on safety and security protocols during public events. Additionally, multiple drone crashes were reported, including one involving a police drone in Taylor, Michigan, which crashed during emergency response efforts. Other incidents involved security alerts over suspected drones in Jammu and Kashmir, suggesting ongoing threats in the region. These events underline the critical issues surrounding drone usage for both illicit activities and public safety.",
