Notably, two Russian drones crashed in a Belarusian border town, raising concerns about drone operations near conflict zones. Additionally, Ukraine reported 82 drone strikes launched by Russia, highlighting escalating tensions and potential risks associated with drone terrorism. In Asia, the number of unauthorized drone flights near Incheon International Airport has seen a significant drop, suggesting improvements in security.
